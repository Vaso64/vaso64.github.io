The primary mechanic of the game are so-called \"portals\", a set of surfaces connecting two distant spaces together, both visually and physically. The player's goal is to progress through the convoluted maze by solving various challenging puzzles, often requiring unconventional and creative outside-of-the-box thinking. The game features complex systems such as space reorientation, scale manipulation, and time dilation.",
