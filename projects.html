                description="A work-in-progress and highly experimental virtual reality game, which utilizes advanced rendering techniques to create various optical illusions and impossible geometry effects.
                The primary mechanic of the game are so-called &quot;portals&quot;, a set of surfaces connecting two distant spaces together, both visually and physically.
                Player's goal is to progress through the convoluted maze by solving various challenging puzzles, often requiring unconventional and creative thinking.
                The game features complex systems such as space reorientation, scale manipulation and time dilation."
